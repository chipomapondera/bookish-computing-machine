# github-api-project
In this project I use my knowledge of JavaScript to build a small application that gives back information about a GitHub user - 
it shows their username, information and their picture.  
It demonstrates my understanding of HTTP Requests, APIs, GET, JSON and JQuery.

This is a project from the codebar JavaScript tutorials.
